# Simple Counter

A basic counter application built with HTML and JavaScript. This project allows you to increment or decrement a displayed count by pressing buttons.

## Project Structure

- **counter.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the counter display and buttons.
- **counter.js**: Contains JavaScript functions to handle the counter logic (increment and decrement actions).

## Features

- Increment the count by clicking the "+" button.
- Decrement the count by clicking the "-" button.
- Real-time display update for each button click.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `counter.html` in a web browser.
3. Click the "+" button to increase the count and the "-" button to decrease it.

## Code Overview

- `count` (variable): Stores the current count.
- `updateDisplay()` (function): Updates the displayed count in the HTML.
- `increment()` (function): Increases the count by 1 and updates the display.
- `decrement()` (function): Decreases the count by 1 and updates the display.

## Future Improvements

- Add a reset button to set the count to 0.
- Set a maximum or minimum count limit.
- Style the buttons and display for a better UI.
